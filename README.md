# Tailspin

A lightweight, open-source tool designed to streamline local log file monitoring
during development. It consists of:

* Rust Binary: a minimal and auditable log file watcher that sends each new line
  as a websocket message
* Web GUI: a flexible interface for viewing and navigating log data over
  websockets

Tailspin is ideal for local development environments with multiple servicesâ€“-a
simpler alternative to crowded terminal outputs or 3rd party SaaS tools that
don't work for local logs.
